    "The $group stage groups the documents by skill and calculates the average height of employees with that skill.\n",

    "Aggregation Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "The aggregation result is a list of skill-average height pairs.\n",
    "For example, it reveals that employees with the skill \"Data Analysis\" have an average height of 135.56 cm, while those with \"Team Leadership\" skills have an average height of 145.00 cm.\n",
    "In summary, this aggregation provides insights into the height distribution of employees based on their skills. By splitting the skills array and calculating the average height for each skill group, it helps identify potential correlations or patterns between skills and employee heights."
